## Overview

This is a billing system designed for a mass transit system that consists of a network of train stations, each belonging to a pricing zone. The system records user journeys with their user ID, direction (IN/OUT of the station), the station, and the time of entry/exit (in UTC) for a given period. The data is sorted by timestamp but not necessarily by users.

### Billing System
The billing system has the following cost structure for journeys:

There is a £2 base fee for all journeys, and additional costs based on the entry and exit zones.

| Zone | In / Out additional Cost |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | £0.80                    |
| 2-3  | £0.50                    |
| 4-5  | £0.30                    |
| 6+   | £0.10                    |

### Example 1: 
zone 1 -> zone 1 = £2.00 + £0.80 + £0.80 = £3.60

### Example 2: 
zone 6 -> zone 4 = £2.00 + £0.10 + £0.30 = £2.40

For any erroneous journeys where an IN or OUT is missing, a £5 fee is charged as the total journey price. It should be assumed that all valid journeys are completed before midnight (i.e., all valid journeys will have an IN and an OUT on the same day).

There is a daily cap of £15 and a monthly cap of £100. Once a given cap is reached, the customer pays no extra for that day or month.

### Assumptions
- The program and tests are run as explained in the [Usage](#usage) section.
- CSV files are provided for the station zone map and journey data.
- The CSV files are encoded in UTF-8.
- The CSV files contain valid data in the correct format, and there are no
  missing values.
- Zone names will be formatted as integers starting from 1.
- Stations will only be in one zone.
- There are no restrictions on customers tapping in or out of stations outside
  of those stated in the specification.
- Pricing of the zones will remain fixed for the foreseeable future.
- Any future changes to a station's zone will not be backdated, so refunds or
  additional charges will not be required.
- There will be future extensions to the system, so the program is designed to
  be easily extended.

### Running the Program

No external libraries are required to run the program.

To run the program, use the following command from the src directory:


```bash
<your_program> <zones_file_path> <journey_data_path> <output_file_path>
```

Expected Output: each user_id and their billing_amount written to <output_file_path> in user_id
alphanumeric increasing order(e.g. ['23Charlie', 'alpha', 'bravo']) as shown in the example output
file.

e.g. To run a python solution

```bash
python my_solution.py zone_map.csv journey_data.csv output.csv
```

or for a Go solution:

```bash
go run main.go zone_map.csv journey_data.csv output.csv
```
